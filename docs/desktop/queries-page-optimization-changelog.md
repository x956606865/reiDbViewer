# Queries Page Optimization Changelog

## Phase 2 â€“ Unified Execution Hook

- Date: 2025-09-24
- Summary: extracted `useQueryExecutor` to centralize preview/execute/explain flows, migrated `apps/desktop/src/routes/queries.tsx` to the hook, and added unit coverage for pagination/count/autocalc branches.
- Automated tests: `pnpm test apps/desktop/src/hooks/queries/useQueryExecutor.test.ts`, `pnpm test apps/desktop/src/hooks/queries/usePaginationState.test.ts`.
- Manual verification checklist (pending):
  - [ ] Temp query preview/execute/explain respond correctly with connection warnings.
  - [ ] Saved query preview/execute/explain refresh pagination and totals.
  - [ ] Count-only refresh updates total rows without clearing last result.
  - [ ] Auto calc items trigger on first run and always modes.
  - [ ] Script runner actions continue to operate while queries execute.
- Notes: manual smoke to be completed in next desktop run before Phase 3 rollout.
