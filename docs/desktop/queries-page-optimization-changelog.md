# Queries Page Optimization Changelog

## Phase 2 – Unified Execution Hook

- Date: 2025-09-24
- Summary: extracted `useQueryExecutor` to centralize preview/execute/explain flows, migrated `apps/desktop/src/routes/queries.tsx` to the hook, and added unit coverage for pagination/count/autocalc branches.
- Automated tests: `pnpm test apps/desktop/src/hooks/queries/useQueryExecutor.test.ts`, `pnpm test apps/desktop/src/hooks/queries/usePaginationState.test.ts`.
- Manual verification checklist (pending):
  - [ ] Temp query preview/execute/explain respond correctly with connection warnings.
  - [ ] Saved query preview/execute/explain refresh pagination and totals.
  - [ ] Count-only refresh updates total rows without clearing last result.
  - [ ] Auto calc items trigger on first run and always modes.
  - [ ] Script runner actions continue to operate while queries execute.
- Notes: manual smoke to be completed in next desktop run before Phase 3 rollout.

## Phase 6 – Final Regression & Documentation

- Date: 2025-09-24
- Summary: completed Phase 6 acceptance by producing the regression report, user guide, and developer hook overview; verified hook-level Vitest coverage and confirmed `queries.tsx` now sits at 950 LoC (<1200 target).
- Automated tests: 
  - `pnpm test apps/desktop/src/hooks/queries/useQueryExecutor.test.ts`
  - `pnpm test apps/desktop/src/hooks/queries/usePaginationState.test.ts`
  - `pnpm test apps/desktop/src/hooks/queries/useSavedSqlSelection.test.ts`
  - `pnpm test apps/desktop/src/hooks/queries/useQueryApiScriptTask.test.ts`
  - `pnpm test apps/desktop/src/hooks/queries/useRuntimeCalc.test.ts`
- Manual verification checklist:
  - [ ] Saved query lifecycle (open/save/delete) on desktop runtime.
  - [ ] Temp query execution and variable reset.
  - [ ] Pagination/totals refresh with count-only flow.
  - [ ] Runtime calc auto-run and manual retry.
  - [ ] API script run/cancel/export/log operations.
- Notes: manual QA remains blocked inside the sandbox; coordinate with desktop QA to execute the above checklist on a local build and update `queries-page-phase6-regression-report.md` once completed.
